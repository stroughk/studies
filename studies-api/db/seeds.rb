# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
studies = Study.create([
    { programming_language: 'Javascript', topic: 'Arrays', description: 'Arrays are special variables, which can hold more than one value at a time.'}, 
    { programming_language: 'Ruby', topic: 'Hashes', description: 'Hashes are collections of key-value pairs.' }])
